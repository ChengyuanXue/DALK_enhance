[{"question": "If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon. Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down. With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations. Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.) Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds. Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,\" he says, \"Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators.\" According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Lawyers.", "Farmers.", "Clerks.", "Shop assistants."], "answer": 0, "entity": "1.

It was a tradition that I started when they were young. Each time I went to see them, I would take a large bag filled with toys, coloring books, candy, magic markers and \"games\". The contents  were different but the rules were not. They included: one may get a turn to choose what activity we would do; another may take a turn to go first when we played a game; ..... We shared the treats after the games and cleaned up after we played . Then, sadly, they watched the Surprise Travel Bag go away with their Auntie. Now my niece and nephew have grown into young adults. They spend most of their visits listening to their iPods, messaging on their phones.... I completely forgot that I had put my two Surprise Travel Bags in the basement  until my husband found them this weekend. I held the bags tightly in my arms, remembering our laughter and fun-filled get-togethers.

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages.

The telecommunications service provider,with the support o,f the local govemment,started the GPS tracking service in January to help the elderly,especially those with Alzheimer's disease,a condition that slowly destroys memory. Huang Haiying,an employee with a local telecommunications company,told China Daily that with the GPS devices ,the people who look after the elderly can quickly find their positions either online or by ca l l ing the service center in case ot emergencles. The system is also connected to the police,hospitals,fire services and community service centers to ensure that the elderly get quick and proper help,Huang said. Experts said that this service could improve the quality of life for thousands of elderly people with Alzheimer's,their families and those who look after them. Hundreds of people have already been helped by the service this year,Huang said. Huang said that the system has about 1 0,000 subscribers and she expects that number to grow 1 0 times over the next three years.A user pays 25 yuan($4)each month for the service.A family with an income below the local poverty line can get a 10 yuan subsidy evcry month from the government. The local government has spent more than 2 million yuan to subsidize the service to date.

A team of psychologists in Toronto created a strategy of cognitive training to help people preserve these abilities.\"Our primary emphasis was on improving the use of general strategic abilities because they are particularly weak to the aging process,\"Dr.Donald Stuss,director of the study,said in a press release.The team examined 49 healthy older adults with normal cognitive decline.All of the participants were between the ages of 71 and 87.Over the course of 12 weeks,psychologists taught them methods to improve their strategic abilities.Afterwards,researchers saw a 15 to 40 percent improvement in the memories of all participants.\"Over a period of six months their improvement not only maintained,but increased,\"said Dr.Gordon Winocur,coordinator of the study.The 12-week course was broken up into three four-week sections,focusing on a different skill involved in strategic abilities:memory,goal management and psychosocial function. The memory training emphasized how to preserve and recover information, while goal management focused on methods to lower the chance of memory slips.Psychosocial training was aimed at increasing the participants' confidence in their mental abilities. \"We wanted to develop a cognitive training program that would produce improvement over a  ly short period of time,so participants could benefit more on that while they're still functional and slow down the rate of decline,\"said Winocur.\"If we can work with people in the early stages of cognitive decline,then we can slow down the rate of this decline and help them maintain a higher level of function for a longer period of time.\" How many strategic abilities do the psychologists mainly focus on?

People who have hearing trouble suffered meaningful impairments in memory, attention and learning about three years earlier than people with normal hearing, a study published online January 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals. The finding supports the idea that hearing loss can have serious consequences for the brain,says Patricia Tun of Brandeis University in Waltham,Mass., who studies aging. \"I'm hoping it will be a real wake-up call in terms of realizing the importance of hearing. \" Compared with other senses, hearing is often overlooked, Tun says. \"We are made to interact with language and to listen to each other, and it can have damaging effects if we don't.\" Frank Lin of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and colleagues tested the hearing of 1,984 older adults. Most of the participants, who averaged 77 years old, showed some hearing loss -- 1,162 volunteers had trouble hearing noises of less than 25 decibels, comparable to a whisper or rustling leaves. The volunteers; deficits reflect the hearing loss in the general population: Over half of people older than 70 have trouble hearing. Over the next six years, these participants underwent mental evaluations that measured factors such as short-term memory, attention and the ability to quickly match numbers to symbols. Everybody got worse at the tasks as time wore on, but people with hearing loss had an especially sharp decline, the team found. On average, a substantial drop in performance would come about three years earlier to people with hearing loss. Lin cautions that the study has found an association between hearing loss and mental abilities; the researchers can't conclude that hearing loss directly causes the decline. Yet more and more studies are turning up ways that diminished hearing could damage the brain. A person who can't hear well might avoid social situations, and isolation is known to be bad for the brain. \"You gradually become more socially withdrawn, \" Lin says. \"Social isolation is a major, major factor for dementia and cognitive decline. \" Other studies suggest that when people struggle to interpret and decode words, their brains _ energy away from other tasks, such as memory. Audiologist and psychologist Kathy Pichora -- Fuller says that this brain drain happens to everyone, even people without hearing loss. Studies have shown that people are worse at remembering things when they're in a noisy room, for instance. People with hearing loss may be constantly diverting a large swath(--)of their brainpower,leaving less for other mental tasks, says Pichora-- Fuller, of the University of Toronto Mississauga.

Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \"a beautiful natural experiment\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\" he said. \"Actually, it's beneficial. \" What's the main idea of the passage?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Researchers found that speaking two languages is important.", "Researchers found that bilingual people respond slowly.", "Researchers found that bilingual people can slow down the speed or aging on the brain and respond fast.", "Researchers found that bilingual people are great."], "answer": 2, "entity": "1.

In fact, a new study suggests that violence not only leaves long-term scars on children's bodies, but also changes their DNA, causing changes that are equal to seven to ten years of premature aging  . Scientists measured this by studying the ends of children's chromosomes  , called telomeres, says Idan Shalev, lead author of a study published in Molecular Psychiatry. Telomeres are special DNA sequences   which prevent the DNA in chromosomes from separating. They get shorter each time a cell divides, until a cell cannot divide any more and dies. Several factors have been found to shorten telomeres, including smoking, radiation and psychological stresses such as being treated badly when young and taking care of a chronically ill person. In this study, researchers examined whether exposure to violence could make children's telomeres shorten faster than normal. They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, physical maltreatment by an adult or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres--in cells obtained from the insides of their cheeks--at ages 5 and 10. Telomeres shortened faster in kids exposed to two or more types of violence, says Shalev. Unless that pattern changes, the study suggests, these kids could be expected to develop diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or memory loss, seven to 10 years earlier than their peers. Shalev says there is hope for these kids. His study found that, in rare cases, telomeres can lengthen. Better nutrition, exercise and stress reduction are three things that may be able to lengthen telomeres, he says. The study confirms a smallbutgrowing number of studies suggesting that early childhood hardship imprints itself in our chromosomes, says Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.

Now, a large national study from Brandeis University published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry shows that those with less schooling can significantly make up for poorer education by frequently engaging in mental exercises such as word games, puzzles, reading, and lectures.        \"The lifelong benefits of higher education for memory in later life are quite impressive, but we do not clearly understand how and why these effects last so long,\" said lead author Margie Lachman, a psychologist.

{"question": "If you don't have a college degree, you're at greater risk of developing memory problems or even Alzheimer's  . Education plays a key role in lifelong memory performance and risk for mental disorder, and it's well documented that those with a college degree possess a cognitive  advantage over those less educated in middle and old age.        Now, a large national study from Brandeis University published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry shows that those with less schooling can significantly make up for poorer education by frequently engaging in mental exercises such as word games, puzzles, reading, and lectures.        \"The lifelong benefits of higher education for memory in later life are quite impressive, but we do not clearly understand how and why these effects last so long,\" said lead author Margie Lachman, a psychologist. She suggested that higher education may encourage lifelong interest in cognitive efforts, while those with less education may not engage as frequently in mental exercises that help keep the memory agile  .        But education early in adulthood does not appear to be the only route to maintain your memory. The study found that intellectual activities undertaken regularly made a difference. \"Among individuals with low education, those who are engaged in reading, writing, attending lectures, doing word games or puzzles once a week or more had memory scores similar to people with more education,\" said Lachman.        The study, called Midlife in the United States, assessed 3,343 men and women between the ages of 32 and 84 with an average age of 56 years. Almost 40 percent of the participants had at least a 4-year college degree. The researchers evaluated how the participants performed in two cognitive areas, verbal  memory and executive function --- brain processes involved in planning, abstract thinking and cognitive flexibility. Participants were given a series of tests, including tests of verbal fluency, word recall, and backward counting.        As expected, those with higher education said they engaged in cognitive activities more often and also did better on the memory tests, but some with lower education also did well, explained Lachman.        \"The findings are promising because they suggest there may be ways to level the playing field for those with lower educational achievement, and protect those at greatest risk for memory declines,\" said Lachman. \"Although we can not rule out the possibility that those who have better memories are the ones who take on more activities, the evidence is consistent with cognitive plasticity  , and suggests some degree of personal control over cognitive functioning in adulthood by adopting an intellectually active lifestyle.\" Why are the findings of the Lachman's study promising?", "subject": "", "choices": ["The lower educated may have the same opportunities to keep up memory.", "We may have ways to cure the people who have memory declines.", "Adopting a different lifestyle can control cognitive functioning.", "We can find out the possibility to have better memories."], "answer": 0, "entity": "1.

However,there was some decline in their psycho-motor speed. This means that it took them longer to accomplish mental tasks than it used to.But when speed was not a factor,they lost very little intellectual   ability over the years.In general,Dr.Jarvik's studies have shown that there is no decline in knowledge or reasoning ability.This is true not only into the 30s and 40s,but into the 60s and 70s as well. As for learning new things,and ability to remember,studies by Dr.Jarvik and others show that the old are equal to the young.It is true that older people themselves often complain that their memory is not as good as it once was.However,much of  what we call\"loss of memory\"is not that at a11. In the cases where the older person's mind really seems to decline,it is not necessarilv a sign of a decay due to becoming old or\"senility\".Often it is simply a sign of a depressed emotional state.This depression usually can be got rid of by counseling with a psychologist,or medicine which fights depression. In American society,when an older person loses something,we tend to call him or her\"senile\".But notice that when a younger person loses something,he does not blame it on senility or loss of memory.He finds some other excuse!

he grows older.But this is not true,according to Dr.Lissy F.Jarvik,professor of psychiatry at the University of California,Los Angeles,and a board member of the New Center for Aging at the Veterans Hospital.She has studied the mental functioning of aging persons for several years.For example,one of her studies concerns 136 pairs of twins, who were first examined when they were already 60 years old.As Dr.Jarvik continued the study of the twins into their 70s and 80s,their minds did not generally decline as was expected. However,there was some decline in their psycho-motor speed. This means that it took them longer to accomplish mental tasks than it used to.But when speed was not a factor,they lost very little intellectual   ability over the years.In general,Dr.Jarvik's studies have shown that there is no decline in knowledge or reasoning ability.This is true not only into the 30s and 40s,but into the 60s and 70s as well. As for learning new things,and ability to remember,studies by Dr.Jarvik and others show that the old are equal to the young.It is true that older people themselves often complain that their memory is not as good as it once was.However,much of  what we call\"loss of memory\"is not that at a11. In the cases where the older person's mind really seems to decline,it is not necessarilv a sign of a decay due to becoming old or\"senility\".Often it is simply a sign of a depressed emotional state.This depression usually can be got rid of by counseling with a psychologist,or medicine which fights depression. In American society,when an older person loses something,we tend to call him or her\"senile\".But notice that when a younger person loses something,he does not blame it on senility or loss of memory.He finds some other excuse!

Robots, such as the sound-sensitive Chapit, answer simple questions and even joke with people to help the _ fight loneliness and stay alert   in old age. \"Many old people in Japan live alone and have no one to talk to,\" said Kazuya Kitamura, a representative of the expo organizer. \"Communication robots stay together with old people and don't mind listening to the same stories over and over again.\" While Chapit, a relatively simple robot, managed to attract a partner, many researchers, such as Kiyoshi Matsumoto, a professor at the University of Tokyo, struggle to attract sponsors for more expensive projects. Matsumoto's \"Personal Mobility Robot\", equipped with four cameras and a sensor to recognize the user's centre of gravity, is designed to help the elderly move around without pressing buttons as in traditional wheelchairs. The robot can also help find misplaced glasses by recognizing them with a sensor. \"We have developed a robot that can assist many people, but because of the high cost, we still haven't found a sponsor,\" said Matsumoto, who added that the cost of the machine, if produced in large quantities, would be comparable to that of a small car. \"In the current economic environment there are few companies willing to invest   in such a costly project,\" he said. Other robots, such as the award-winning \"DiGRO\", can support busy parents who have little time to play with their children. The robot can use the Internet to find a simple image and then draw pictures, looking after children while parents work. Japan is one of the world's fastest-aging countries and the government predicts that by 2050 the population of people over 65 will reach 40 percent.

There is increasing evidence to show that reading isn't merely a way of improving literacy and knowledge, but that it might actually be good for one's mental and physical health, too. In the age of Twitter and short attention spans, reading novels, which requires intense concentration over a long period of time, could be the antidote . Neuroscientists Baroness Susan Greenfield says that reading helps to lengthen attention spans in children and improve their ability to think clearly. \"Stories have a structure that encourages our brain to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance,\" she says \"It is essential to learn this skill as a small child.\" \"In a computer game, you might rescue a princess, but you don't care about her, you just want to win,\" she explains, \"But a princess in a book has a past, present and future. You can relate to her. You see the world through her eyes\" According to professor John Stein, Oxford university, reading is far from a passive activity. \"Reading exercises the whole brain,\" he explains. \" When we get lost in a good book, we are doing more than following a story, Imaging what is happening is as good as activating the brain as doing it. In other words, our brains simulate  real experiences, and it is just as if we were experiencing them ourselves. This doesn't happen when we are watching a TV or playing computer games.\" Getting stuck in a good novel appears to be good for one's mental health. Reading helps one not only fights loneliness, but also forget one's own problems for a while. Researchers found that just six minutes of reading could reduce stress levels by more than two-thirds, more than listening to music or going out for a walk. The concentration required to read distracts the mind, easing muscle's tension and slowing the heart rate. Reading may be good for physical health, too, by preventing brain aging and disease.

In one investigation, they analyzed data on 3610 people, aged 24 to 96. They found that the higher their level of social interaction  , the better their cognitive   functioning.  Social interaction includes getting together or having phone chats with relatives, freinds and neighbors. In another experiment, the researchers conducted lab tests on 76 college students, aged 18 to 21, to evaluate how social interactions and intellectual exercises affected the results of memory and mental performance tests. The students were divided into three groups: the social interaction group had a discussion of a social issue for 10 minutes before taking the tests; the intellectual activities group completed three tasks (including a reading comprehension exercise and a crossword puzzle) before the tests; and a control group   watched a 10-minute clip   of the Seinfeld television show. \"We found that short-term social interaction lasting for just 10 minutes improved participants' intellectual performance as much as engaging in so-called 'intellectual' activities for the same amount of time,\" Ybarra said.

'We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive  abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like KLOTHO can give people a boost in aging. Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's disease ,\" said senior author, Dena Dubal of University of California. The KLOTHO gene affects a protein found in the kidneys and the brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the varian, known as KL-VS,which boosts levels of the protein and is associated with a longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan. In the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the KLOTHO gene. They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as RDLPFC, which is especially likely to shrink with age. Loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to do more than one task at the same time. Researcher Dr Jennifer Yokoyama said, \" The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and some mental disease. In this case, bigger size means better function. It will be important to determine whether the structure increase associated with carrying one copy of KL-VS can _ the cognitive shortage caused by disease.\"[:] People who have one copy of a variant KL-VS tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke  ,whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke.

'We've known for a long time that people lose cognitive  abilities as they age, but now we're beginning to understand that factors like KLOTHO can give people a boost in aging. Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's disease ,\" said senior author, Dena Dubal of University of California. The KLOTHO gene affects a protein found in the kidneys and the brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the varian, known as KL-VS,which boosts levels of the protein and is associated with a longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan. In the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the KLOTHO gene. They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as RDLPFC, which is especially likely to shrink with age. Loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to do more than one task at the same time. Researcher Dr Jennifer Yokoyama said, \" The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and some mental disease. In this case, bigger size means better function. It will be important to determine whether the structure increase associated with carrying one copy of KL-VS can _ the cognitive shortage caused by disease.\"[:] People who have one copy of a variant KL-VS tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke  ,whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke.

The neighbour wisely decided to disobey orders. Harris desperately wanted to get to the hospital immediately, but she couldn't. She lives in Washington, D.C, and her mother lives in California. For the past year a half, Harris has gone to Los Angeles every other month to take care of her mother. Flora Harris takes care of her husband, James, who's 91 and has Alzheimer's disease. They live in their own home, and a caregiver comes to help them a few hours a day. Harris is one of many Americans facing the heartache of how to take care of aging parents from afar. She's often worried, not to mention extremely busy with a demanding job, two teenage daughters and the frequent trips to California. In some ways, Harris is lucky. She has the resources to make the trips to Los Angeles. Plus, Harris is a doctor who treats the elderly. \" But it's still tough,\" she said. \" I can foresee what the next few years are going to look like, and it's not a pretty picture. My father's going to need diapers  . There will come a time when he won' t recognize me and he's easily excited. I worry he's going to be violent and hurt my mother.\" So what do you do when you live a continent away for your aging, sick parents? There are no magic answers.

I want to sleep late as I like.\" \"If there's one thing I can't stand,it's a quitter.\"Her voice in my head is more powerful than my will to refuse,so I pull myself from bed. Before I was out of primary school,mother could see I lacked the gifts for either making millions or winning the love of crowds.So she began pushing me toward working with words. _ .There seemed to be a word gene that passed down from her mother's grandfather* The greatest proof was my mother's first cousin Edwin.He was the managing editor of the New York Times and had gained a name in his career. In 1947 1 graduated from Johns Hopkins and applied for a job with the Baltimore Sun as a police reporter.It paid$30 a week .When I complained the wage was shameful for a learned man,mother refused to sympathize.\"If you work hard at this job,\"she said,\"maybe you can make something of it.\" After a while,I was asked to cover diplomats at various African embassies. Then, seven years later I was arranged by the Sun to cover the White House,a task that was as close to heaven as a journalist could get.However,whatever achievement of mine only seemed insignificant in her eyes.Uncle Edwin's success was really annoying during my early years as a reporter.What a thrill,I thought. Then,out of my wildest childhood fantasy,the Times came knocking.It was sad that Uncle Edwin had passed away by this time.In 1979 I won the Pulitzer Prize.Unfortunately,my mother's brain and health broke down the year before,leaving her in a nursing home,out of touch with life forevermore .She never knew of my Pulitzer. I can probably guess how she'd have responded.\" That's nice,buddy.It shows if you work hand,you'11 be able to make something of yourself one day,\" What can we learn about the author", "subject": "", "choices": ["He got a good salary working as a police reporter.", "He lived a rich life with his mother in his childhood.", "It was proud of her mother to see his winning the Pulitzer Prize.", "It was beyond his wildest dream that he could work for the Times."], "answer": 3, "entity": "1.
