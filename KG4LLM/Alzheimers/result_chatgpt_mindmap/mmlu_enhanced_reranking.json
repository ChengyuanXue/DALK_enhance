[{"question": "If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon. Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down. With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations. Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.) Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds. Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,\" he says, \"Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators.\" According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Lawyers.", "Farmers.", "Clerks.", "Shop assistants."], "answer": 0, "entity": "1.

For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

Scientists have discovered that old bees have trouble finding their way to new hives as their learning behavior becomes increasingly inflexible.    Bees are typically impressive navigators, able to wind their way home through complex landscapes after visits to flowers far removed from their nests. But researchers from Arizona State University and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that aging damages the bees' ability to extinguish the memory of an unsuitable nest site even after the group has settled in a new home.    To test how old bees adapt to a changed home location, researchers trained bees to a new nest box while their former nest was closed off. Groups composed of mature and old bees were given several days in which to learn the new home location and to extinguish the bees' memory of their unusable former nest box. The scientists then tore down the bees' new home and forced groups of mixed-age bees to choose between three alternative nest locations, including the former nest box.    Old bees began flying toward the former nest site, despite the experience that should have told them that it was unusable. \"Although many old bees fail in learning tasks, we also discovered that a few still perform with excellence,\" explains Daniel Minch, lead author of the study and a senior life sciences researcher in Norway.

People who have hearing trouble suffered meaningful impairments in memory, attention and learning about three years earlier than people with normal hearing, a study published online January 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals. The finding supports the idea that hearing loss can have serious consequences for the brain,says Patricia Tun of Brandeis University in Waltham,Mass., who studies aging. \"I'm hoping it will be a real wake-up call in terms of realizing the importance of hearing. \" Compared with other senses, hearing is often overlooked, Tun says. \"We are made to interact with language and to listen to each other, and it can have damaging effects if we don't.\" Frank Lin of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and colleagues tested the hearing of 1,984 older adults. Most of the participants, who averaged 77 years old, showed some hearing loss -- 1,162 volunteers had trouble hearing noises of less than 25 decibels, comparable to a whisper or rustling leaves. The volunteers; deficits reflect the hearing loss in the general population: Over half of people older than 70 have trouble hearing. Over the next six years, these participants underwent mental evaluations that measured factors such as short-term memory, attention and the ability to quickly match numbers to symbols. Everybody got worse at the tasks as time wore on, but people with hearing loss had an especially sharp decline, the team found. On average, a substantial drop in performance would come about three years earlier to people with hearing loss. Lin cautions that the study has found an association between hearing loss and mental abilities; the researchers can't conclude that hearing loss directly causes the decline. Yet more and more studies are turning up ways that diminished hearing could damage the brain. A person who can't hear well might avoid social situations, and isolation is known to be bad for the brain. \"You gradually become more socially withdrawn, \" Lin says. \"Social isolation is a major, major factor for dementia and cognitive decline. \" Other studies suggest that when people struggle to interpret and decode words, their brains _ energy away from other tasks, such as memory. Audiologist and psychologist Kathy Pichora -- Fuller says that this brain drain happens to everyone, even people without hearing loss. Studies have shown that people are worse at remembering things when they're in a noisy room, for instance. People with hearing loss may be constantly diverting a large swath(--)of their brainpower,leaving less for other mental tasks, says Pichora-- Fuller, of the University of Toronto Mississauga.

Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \"a beautiful natural experiment\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\" he said. \"Actually, it's beneficial. \" What's the main idea of the passage?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Researchers found that speaking two languages is important.", "Researchers found that bilingual people respond slowly.", "Researchers found that bilingual people can slow down the speed or aging on the brain and respond fast.", "Researchers found that bilingual people are great."], "answer": 2, "entity": "1.

In fact, a new study suggests that violence not only leaves long-term scars on children's bodies, but also changes their DNA, causing changes that are equal to seven to ten years of premature aging  . Scientists measured this by studying the ends of children's chromosomes  , called telomeres, says Idan Shalev, lead author of a study published in Molecular Psychiatry. Telomeres are special DNA sequences   which prevent the DNA in chromosomes from separating. They get shorter each time a cell divides, until a cell cannot divide any more and dies. Several factors have been found to shorten telomeres, including smoking, radiation and psychological stresses such as being treated badly when young and taking care of a chronically ill person. In this study, researchers examined whether exposure to violence could make children's telomeres shorten faster than normal. They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, physical maltreatment by an adult or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres--in cells obtained from the insides of their cheeks--at ages 5 and 10. Telomeres shortened faster in kids exposed to two or more types of violence, says Shalev. Unless that pattern changes, the study suggests, these kids could be expected to develop diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or memory loss, seven to 10 years earlier than their peers. Shalev says there is hope for these kids. His study found that, in rare cases, telomeres can lengthen. Better nutrition, exercise and stress reduction are three things that may be able to lengthen telomeres, he says. The study confirms a smallbutgrowing number of studies suggesting that early childhood hardship imprints itself in our chromosomes, says Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.

However,there was some decline in their psycho-motor speed. This means that it took them longer to accomplish mental tasks than it used to.But when speed was not a factor,they lost very little intellectual   ability over the years.In general,Dr.Jarvik's studies have shown that there is no decline in knowledge or reasoning ability.This is true not only into the 30s and 40s,but into the 60s and 70s as well. As for learning new things,and ability to remember,studies by Dr.Jarvik and others show that the old are equal to the young.It is true that older people themselves often complain that their memory is not as good as it once was.However,much of  what we call\"loss of memory\"is not that at a11. In the cases where the older person's mind really seems to decline,it is not necessarilv a sign of a decay due to becoming old or\"senility\".Often it is simply a sign of a depressed emotional state.This depression usually can be got rid of by counseling with a psychologist,or medicine which fights depression. In American society,when an older person loses something,we tend to call him or her\"senile\".But notice that when a younger person loses something,he does not blame it on senility or loss of memory.He finds some other excuse!

Matsumoto's \"Personal Mobility Robot\", equipped with four cameras and a sensor to recognize the user's centre of gravity, is designed to help the elderly move around without pressing buttons as in traditional wheelchairs. The robot can also help find misplaced glasses by recognizing them with a sensor. \"We have developed a robot that can assist many people, but because of the high cost, we still haven't found a sponsor,\" said Matsumoto, who added that the cost of the machine, if produced in large quantities, would be comparable to that of a small car. \"In the current economic environment there are few companies willing to invest   in such a costly project,\" he said. Other robots, such as the award-winning \"DiGRO\", can support busy parents who have little time to play with their children. The robot can use the Internet to find a simple image and then draw pictures, looking after children while parents work.

There is increasing evidence to show that reading isn't merely a way of improving literacy and knowledge, but that it might actually be good for one's mental and physical health, too. In the age of Twitter and short attention spans, reading novels, which requires intense concentration over a long period of time, could be the antidote . Neuroscientists Baroness Susan Greenfield says that reading helps to lengthen attention spans in children and improve their ability to think clearly. \"Stories have a structure that encourages our brain to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance,\" she says \"It is essential to learn this skill as a small child.\" \"In a computer game, you might rescue a princess, but you don't care about her, you just want to win,\" she explains, \"But a princess in a book has a past, present and future. You can relate to her. You see the world through her eyes\" According to professor John Stein, Oxford university, reading is far from a passive activity. \"Reading exercises the whole brain,\" he explains. \" When we get lost in a good book, we are doing more than following a story, Imaging what is happening is as good as activating the brain as doing it. In other words, our brains simulate  real experiences, and it is just as if we were experiencing them ourselves. This doesn't happen when we are watching a TV or playing computer games.\" Getting stuck in a good novel appears to be good for one's mental health. Reading helps one not only fights loneliness, but also forget one's own problems for a while. Researchers found that just six minutes of reading could reduce stress levels by more than two-thirds, more than listening to music or going out for a walk. The concentration required to read distracts the mind, easing muscle's tension and slowing the heart rate. Reading may be good for physical health, too, by preventing brain aging and disease.

In one investigation, they analyzed data on 3610 people, aged 24 to 96. They found that the higher their level of social interaction  , the better their cognitive   functioning.  Social interaction includes getting together or having phone chats with relatives, freinds and neighbors. In another experiment, the researchers conducted lab tests on 76 college students, aged 18 to 21, to evaluate how social interactions and intellectual exercises affected the results of memory and mental performance tests. The students were divided into three groups: the social interaction group had a discussion of a social issue for 10 minutes before taking the tests; the intellectual activities group completed three tasks (including a reading comprehension exercise and a crossword puzzle) before the tests; and a control group   watched a 10-minute clip   of the Seinfeld television show. \"We found that short-term social interaction lasting for just 10 minutes improved participants' intellectual performance as much as engaging in so-called 'intellectual' activities for the same amount of time,\" Ybarra said.

For the past year a half, Harris has gone to Los Angeles every other month to take care of her mother. Flora Harris takes care of her husband, James, who's 91 and has Alzheimer's disease. They live in their own home, and a caregiver comes to help them a few hours a day. Harris is one of many Americans facing the heartache of how to take care of aging parents from afar. She's often worried, not to mention extremely busy with a demanding job, two teenage daughters and the frequent trips to California. In some ways, Harris is lucky. She has the resources to make the trips to Los Angeles. Plus, Harris is a doctor who treats the elderly. \" But it's still tough,\" she said. \" I can foresee what the next few years are going to look like, and it's not a pretty picture. My father's going to need diapers  . There will come a time when he won' t recognize me and he's easily excited. I worry he's going to be violent and hurt my mother.\" So what do you do when you live a continent away for your aging, sick parents? There are no magic answers.
