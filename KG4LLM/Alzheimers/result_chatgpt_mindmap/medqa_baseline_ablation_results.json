According to his wife, he has always been in good health and is generally very happy; however, he has started to forget important things. He recently had his driving license revoked because of multiple tickets, but he cannot recall having done anything wrong. This morning, he neglected to put on his socks and was quite agitated when she pointed this out to him. He denies having a depressed mood, sleep problems, or loss of interest. He occasionally has a glass of wine with dinner and has never smoked or used recreational drugs. His medical history and family medical history are unremarkable. His pulse is 68/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Except for a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 20/30, the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT of the brain, reveal no pathologic findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also normal.

Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal.

She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present.

Past medical history is significant for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Surgical history is notable for an open cholecystectomy at age 38 and multiple cesarean sections. On arrival, she is non-responsive but breathing by herself, and her vital signs are T 102.9 F, HR 123 bpm, BP 95/64, RR 26/min, and SaO2 97% on 6L nasal cannula. On physical exam the patient has marked abdominal distension and is tympanic to percussion. Laboratory studies are notable for a lactic acidosis. An upright abdominal radiograph and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are shown in Figures A and B respectively. She is started on IV fluids and a nasogastric tube is placed to suction which returns green bilious fluid. Repeat vitals 1 hour later are T 101F, HR 140 bpm, BP 75/44, RR 30/min, and SaO2 is 100% on the ventilator after she is intubated for airway concerns. What is the next best step in management?",

The patient's overall condition deteriorated ever since this initial diagnosis with increasing disability from his motor symptoms, and he recently passed away at the age of 67, 8 years after his first presentation to his physician.

She is also sometimes found conversing in an empty room and, when inquired, she confirms that she is talking to a friend. There have also been had some recent falls. There is no history of fever, recent head trauma, loss of consciousness, or illicit drug use. Past medical history is significant for bronchial asthma and osteoarthritis, both managed medically. Her mother died due to metastatic breast cancer at age 71 and her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 65. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a tremor present in both her hands that attenuates with voluntary movement. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Romberg\u2019s sign is negative. She has a slow gait with a mild stooped posture. Her laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 12.9 g/dL\nWhite cell count  8,520/mm\u00b3\nPlatelets 295,000/mm\u00b3\nSerum creatinine  10 mg/dL\nGlucose 94 mg/dL\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 92 mg/dL\nFerritin 125 ng/mL\nSerum B12 305 ng/L\nTSH 2.1 \u00b5U/mL\nCeruloplasmin 45 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

    "question": "A 72-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife for forgetfulness, confusion, and mood changes for the past 4 months. His symptoms started with misplacing items such as his wallet and keys around the house. Two months ago, he became unable to manage their finances as it became too difficult for him. Last week, he became lost while returning home from the grocery store. His wife reports that he shows \u201cno emotion\u201d and that he is seemingly not concerned by his recent symptoms. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and rosuvastatin. His pulse is 56/min and blood pressure is 158/76 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows loss of sensation on his right leg and an unsteady gait. When asked to stand with his eyes closed and palms facing upward, his right arm rotates inward. An MRI of the brain shows multiple deep white matter lesions.

She was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer type, 5 years ago. The daughter has noticed that in the past 2 years, her mother has had increasing word-finding difficulties and forgetfulness. She was previously independent but now lives with her daughter and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and sometimes regurgitates her food. During this time, she has had a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She was treated twice for aspiration pneumonia and now her diet mainly consists of pureed food. She has no advance directives and her daughter says that when her mother was independent the patient mentioned that she would not want any resuscitation or life-sustaining measures if the need arose. The daughter wants to continue taking care of her mother but is concerned about her ability to do so. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but is well-groomed. The patient is oriented to self and recognizes her daughter by name, but she is unaware of the place or year. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 17/30. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B12 levels are within the reference range. Her serum albumin is 3 g/dL.

She also reports that the patient recently missed a lunch date they had scheduled. She is worried that he may have Alzheimer's disease because her mother had it, and this is how it started. The patient states that he sometimes forgets where he puts his glasses, but this is not new. He also admits to missing appointments if he doesn't write them in his planner, but he states \u201cI always remember birthdays.\u201d Since his wife passed, the patient has been responsible for all the finances, and the daughter confirms that he pays the bills on time. He cooks for himself, though sometimes he is \u201clazy\u201d and will order fast food. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. His medications include aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and methotrexate. He was also treated for depression for the first year following his wife's death, which was 3 years ago. He currently denies feelings of depression or suicidal ideation, but admits that he has been thinking more about death since some of his weekly golfing buddies have passed away. He drinks a beer every night with dinner and smokes cigars socially. A physical examination reveals ulnar deviation of the fingers, decreased grip strength, and a slow, steady gait. The patient is able to spell a 5-letter word backwards and remembers 3/3 items after 5 minutes. Which of the following diagnoses most likely explains the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

She has also noticed that if he is startled by one of their grandchildren, his arm starts to twitch uncontrollably.

The patient is oriented only to person and place. His mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score is 18/30, where he had difficulty performing basic arithmetic calculations and recalled only 1 out of 3 objects. Nuchal rigidity is absent.
