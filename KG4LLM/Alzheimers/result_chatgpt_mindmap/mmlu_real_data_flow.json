[{"question": "If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon. Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down. With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations. Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.) Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds. Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,\" he says, \"Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators.\" According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Lawyers.", "Farmers.", "Clerks.", "Shop assistants."], "answer": 0, "entity": "1.

People who have hearing trouble suffered meaningful impairments in memory, attention and learning about three years earlier than people with normal hearing, a study published online January 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals. The finding supports the idea that hearing loss can have serious consequences for the brain,says Patricia Tun of Brandeis University in Waltham,Mass., who studies aging. \"I'm hoping it will be a real wake-up call in terms of realizing the importance of hearing. \" Compared with other senses, hearing is often overlooked, Tun says. \"We are made to interact with language and to listen to each other, and it can have damaging effects if we don't.\" Frank Lin of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and colleagues tested the hearing of 1,984 older adults. Most of the participants, who averaged 77 years old, showed some hearing loss -- 1,162 volunteers had trouble hearing noises of less than 25 decibels, comparable to a whisper or rustling leaves. The volunteers; deficits reflect the hearing loss in the general population: Over half of people older than 70 have trouble hearing. Over the next six years, these participants underwent mental evaluations that measured factors such as short-term memory, attention and the ability to quickly match numbers to symbols. Everybody got worse at the tasks as time wore on, but people with hearing loss had an especially sharp decline, the team found. On average, a substantial drop in performance would come about three years earlier to people with hearing loss. Lin cautions that the study has found an association between hearing loss and mental abilities; the researchers can't conclude that hearing loss directly causes the decline. Yet more and more studies are turning up ways that diminished hearing could damage the brain. A person who can't hear well might avoid social situations, and isolation is known to be bad for the brain. \"You gradually become more socially withdrawn, \" Lin says. \"Social isolation is a major, major factor for dementia and cognitive decline. \" Other studies suggest that when people struggle to interpret and decode words, their brains _ energy away from other tasks, such as memory. Audiologist and psychologist Kathy Pichora -- Fuller says that this brain drain happens to everyone, even people without hearing loss. Studies have shown that people are worse at remembering things when they're in a noisy room, for instance.

Memory Check First, participants saw a list of 120 real words mixed with 80 nonsense words. Next, they saw another word list and tried to remember which words had been on the first list. Meanwhile, their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance  imaging. While participants reviewed the second word list, their brain scans showed more activity in a certain brain area -- the posterior  median temporal lobe  -- when they saw words that had been on the first word list. But participants didn't always remember that they'd seen those words before. Sometimes, they _ and said they hadn't seen those words before. In other words, the posterior median temporal lobe was more sensitive to memory than participants' consciousness, the researchers note. \"Album\"of Memories Another part of the median temporal lobe also attracted the scientists' attention. The anterior median temporal lobe showed more activity when participants thought they were seeing a new word, the study shows. So, why did participants sometimes mess up their memory recall? It might be that two parts of their brain -- the posterior and anterior median temporal lobes -- might be dueling  for the upper hand in deciding what actually happened in the past, the study notes.

In The Journal of Neuroscience, experts report that the brain might hold more memories than people realize, but that restoring those memories can be tricky. Memory Check First, participants saw a list of 120 real words mixed with 80 nonsense words. Next, they saw another word list and tried to remember which words had been on the first list. Meanwhile, their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance  imaging. While participants reviewed the second word list, their brain scans showed more activity in a certain brain area -- the posterior  median temporal lobe  -- when they saw words that had been on the first word list. But participants didn't always remember that they'd seen those words before. Sometimes, they _ and said they hadn't seen those words before. In other words, the posterior median temporal lobe was more sensitive to memory than participants' consciousness, the researchers note. \"Album\"of Memories Another part of the median temporal lobe also attracted the scientists' attention. The anterior median temporal lobe showed more activity when participants thought they were seeing a new word, the study shows. So, why did participants sometimes mess up their memory recall? It might be that two parts of their brain -- the posterior and anterior median temporal lobes -- might be dueling  for the upper hand in deciding what actually happened in the past, the study notes.

Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \"a beautiful natural experiment\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\" he said. \"Actually, it's beneficial. \" What's the main idea of the passage?", "subject": "", "choices": ["Researchers found that speaking two languages is important.", "Researchers found that bilingual people respond slowly.", "Researchers found that bilingual people can slow down the speed or aging on the brain and respond fast.", "Researchers found that bilingual people are great."], "answer": 2, "entity": "1.

In fact, a new study suggests that violence not only leaves long-term scars on children's bodies, but also changes their DNA, causing changes that are equal to seven to ten years of premature aging  . Scientists measured this by studying the ends of children's chromosomes  , called telomeres, says Idan Shalev, lead author of a study published in Molecular Psychiatry. Telomeres are special DNA sequences   which prevent the DNA in chromosomes from separating. They get shorter each time a cell divides, until a cell cannot divide any more and dies. Several factors have been found to shorten telomeres, including smoking, radiation and psychological stresses such as being treated badly when young and taking care of a chronically ill person. In this study, researchers examined whether exposure to violence could make children's telomeres shorten faster than normal. They interviewed the mothers of 236 children at ages 5, 7 and 10, asking whether the youngsters had been exposed to domestic violence between the mother and her partner, physical maltreatment by an adult or bullying. Researchers measured the children's telomeres--in cells obtained from the insides of their cheeks--at ages 5 and 10. Telomeres shortened faster in kids exposed to two or more types of violence, says Shalev. Unless that pattern changes, the study suggests, these kids could be expected to develop diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or memory loss, seven to 10 years earlier than their peers. Shalev says there is hope for these kids. His study found that, in rare cases, telomeres can lengthen. Better nutrition, exercise and stress reduction are three things that may be able to lengthen telomeres, he says. The study confirms a smallbutgrowing number of studies suggesting that early childhood hardship imprints itself in our chromosomes, says Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.

There is increasing evidence to show that reading isn't merely a way of improving literacy and knowledge, but that it might actually be good for one's mental and physical health, too. In the age of Twitter and short attention spans, reading novels, which requires intense concentration over a long period of time, could be the antidote . Neuroscientists Baroness Susan Greenfield says that reading helps to lengthen attention spans in children and improve their ability to think clearly. \"Stories have a structure that encourages our brain to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance,\" she says \"It is essential to learn this skill as a small child.\" \"In a computer game, you might rescue a princess, but you don't care about her, you just want to win,\" she explains, \"But a princess in a book has a past, present and future. You can relate to her. You see the world through her eyes\" According to professor John Stein, Oxford university, reading is far from a passive activity. \"Reading exercises the whole brain,\" he explains. \" When we get lost in a good book, we are doing more than following a story, Imaging what is happening is as good as activating the brain as doing it. In other words, our brains simulate  real experiences, and it is just as if we were experiencing them ourselves. This doesn't happen when we are watching a TV or playing computer games.\" Getting stuck in a good novel appears to be good for one's mental health. Reading helps one not only fights loneliness, but also forget one's own problems for a while. Researchers found that just six minutes of reading could reduce stress levels by more than two-thirds, more than listening to music or going out for a walk. The concentration required to read distracts the mind, easing muscle's tension and slowing the heart rate. Reading may be good for physical health, too, by preventing brain aging and disease.

In one investigation, they analyzed data on 3610 people, aged 24 to 96. They found that the higher their level of social interaction  , the better their cognitive   functioning.  Social interaction includes getting together or having phone chats with relatives, freinds and neighbors. In another experiment, the researchers conducted lab tests on 76 college students, aged 18 to 21, to evaluate how social interactions and intellectual exercises affected the results of memory and mental performance tests. The students were divided into three groups: the social interaction group had a discussion of a social issue for 10 minutes before taking the tests; the intellectual activities group completed three tasks (including a reading comprehension exercise and a crossword puzzle) before the tests; and a control group   watched a 10-minute clip   of the Seinfeld television show. \"We found that short-term social interaction lasting for just 10 minutes improved participants' intellectual performance as much as engaging in so-called 'intellectual' activities for the same amount of time,\" Ybarra said.

'Alzheimer's disease' is associated with the relationship 'causes' a variety of conditions including 'neuronal death', 'atrophy', 'impairments', 'death', 'anxiety', and 'cognitive deterioration', as well as 'neurotoxicity', 'amyloidosis', 'mitochondrial rupture', and several others.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 2: 'Alzheimer's disease' leads to 'neurodegenerative dementia' characterized by 'cognitive decline', 'memory loss', and 'neuron degeneration', among other effects.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 3: The disease is linked to 'cerebral amyloidosis' and 'senile plaques', which are indicative of 'cognitive impairment' and 'neurodegenerative processes'.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 4: Factors such as 'oxidative stress', 'inflammation', and 'neurotoxic effects' are implicated in the progression of 'Alzheimer's disease', highlighting its complexity.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 5: Genetic mutations like 'APP mutations' and alterations in proteins such as 'Amyloid Precursor Protein' and 'Presenilin 1' are also significant contributors to 'Alzheimer's disease' pathology.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 6: Other conditions, including 'type 2 diabetes' and 'brain inflammation', can exacerbate the symptoms and progression of 'Alzheimer's disease', showing a multifaceted relationship.\n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 7: 'Cognitive dysfunction' and 'memory deficits' are common features experienced by individuals suffering from 'Alzheimer's disease', leading to significant 'language barriers' and 'mental deterioration'. \n\nNeighbor-based Evidence 8: The impact of 'Alzheimer's disease' extends to 'dementias' and 'degenerative diseases', indicating a broad spectrum of cognitive challenges faced by affected individuals. \n\nThese statements encapsulate the relationships and

In 1947 1 graduated from Johns Hopkins and applied for a job with the Baltimore Sun as a police reporter.It paid$30 a week .When I complained the wage was shameful for a learned man,mother refused to sympathize.\"If you work hard at this job,\"she said,\"maybe you can make something of it.\" After a while,I was asked to cover diplomats at various African embassies. Then, seven years later I was arranged by the Sun to cover the White House,a task that was as close to heaven as a journalist could get.However,whatever achievement of mine only seemed insignificant in her eyes.Uncle Edwin's success was really annoying during my early years as a reporter.What a thrill,I thought. Then,out of my wildest childhood fantasy,the Times came knocking.It was sad that Uncle Edwin had passed away by this time.In 1979 I won the Pulitzer Prize.Unfortunately,my mother's brain and health broke down the year before,leaving her in a nursing home,out of touch with life forevermore .She never knew of my Pulitzer.
