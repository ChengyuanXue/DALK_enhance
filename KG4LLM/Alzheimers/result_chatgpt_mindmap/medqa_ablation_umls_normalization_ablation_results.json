She also says that last week, he turned the stove on and forgot about it, resulting in a kitchen fire. The patient has lived by himself since his wife died last year. He fondly recalls living with his wife and how much he misses her. He admits that he feels \u2018down\u2019 most days of the week living on his own and doesn\u2019t have much energy. When asked about the kitchen fire and problems with the electricity, he gets defensive and angry. At the patient\u2019s last routine check-up 3 months ago, he was healthy with no medical problems. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient appears to have a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

He is a partner at an accounting firm, but his colleagues are threatening his job if he continues to perform poorly at work. The patient cannot explain the recent changes to his mood and tearfully admits he fears there is something seriously wrong with him. His wife says that she thinks he is getting worse. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension, for which he takes lisinopril. His family history is unknown as he was adopted. The patient met his mother once, and never knew his father but was told he died in his 50's. He drinks a few glasses of wine per week and has never smoked. On physical exam, the patient has a flat affect with facial grimace and sudden jerky movements of his upper extremities.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be seen on further workup?",

He has difficulty remembering things and events, which has affected his job. He began using a diary to aid with remembering his agenda. His wife also says that he has wet his pants multiple times in the past 2 months and he avoids going out. He has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His past medical history is unremarkable. The vital signs include: blood pressure of 134/76 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 per minute, and a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). His mini-mental state examination (MMSE) result is 22/30. His extraocular movements are normal. The muscle tone and strength are normal in all 4 limbs. The sensory examination is unremarkable. He has an absent Romberg\u2019s sign. He walks slowly, taking small steps, with feet wide apart as if his feet are stuck to the floor. The CT scan of the head is shown in the image. What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient?",

Current medications include donepezil and galantamine. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate 102/min, respiratory rate 22/min. Physical examination reveals several lacerations on his head and extremities. He is oriented only to the person. Urine and blood cultures are positive for E. coli. The patient is admitted and initial treatment with IV fluids, antibiotics, and subcutaneous prophylactic heparin. On the second day of hospitalization, diffuse bleeding from venipuncture sites and wounds is observed. His blood test results show thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and PTT, and a positive D-dimer.

    "question": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter for a follow-up examination. The daughter noticed that he has gradually become more forgetful and withdrawn over the last year. He frequently misplaces his car keys and forgets the names of his neighbors, whom he has known for 30 years. He has difficulty recalling his address and telephone number. He recently had an episode of urinary and fecal incontinence. Last week, his neighbor found him wandering the parking lot of the grocery store. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 18 years ago. His current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He appears healthy; BMI is 23 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg. Mini-mental state examination score is 19/30. He is not bothered by his forgetfulness. Cranial nerves II\u2013XII are intact. He has 5/5 strength and full sensation to light touch in all extremities. His patellar, Achilles, and biceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. His gait is steady. MRI scan of the brain shows ventriculomegaly and prominent cerebral sulci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "question": "A 61-year-old man with Alzheimer disease is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after ingesting an unknown amount of his medications in a suicide attempt. He reports abdominal cramps, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and muscular weakness and spasms in his extremities. His temperature is 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 51/min, respirations are 12/min and labored, and blood pressure is 88/56 mm Hg. Physical examination shows excessive salivation and tearing, and small pupils bilaterally. Treatment with atropine is initiated. Shortly after, most of his symptoms have resolved, but he continues to have muscular spasms. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",

Finally, he has had several episodes of incontinence and has tripped over objects because he \"does not lift his feet off the ground\" while walking. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. His family history is significant for many family members with early onset dementia.

The patient\u2019s daughter states that the memory loss started with her father forgetting things ''here and there'' and the memory loss has progressed to the patient forgetting the names of loved ones and getting lost in familiar places. The medical history is non-contributory. On examination, the patient is awake and alert but only oriented to self (not time or place). The cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are within normal limits. Routine lab work is performed to rule out infection and is found to be within normal limits. Four years later the patient passes away and an autopsy is performed to confirm the presumptive diagnosis. Brain biopsy slides are shown.

Physical exam reveals a confused elderly man who does not respond coherently to questions. Cardiac and pulmonary exam is within normal limits.

    "question": "A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation by a physician with complaints of worsening forgetfulness and confusion for 1 year. According to his wife, he has always been in good health and is generally very happy; however, he has started to forget important things. He recently had his driving license revoked because of multiple tickets, but he cannot recall having done anything wrong. This morning, he neglected to put on his socks and was quite agitated when she pointed this out to him. He denies having a depressed mood, sleep problems, or loss of interest. He occasionally has a glass of wine with dinner and has never smoked or used recreational drugs. His medical history and family medical history are unremarkable. His pulse is 68/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Except for a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 20/30, the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT of the brain, reveal no pathologic findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also normal. Laboratory testing showed the following:\nSerum glucose (fasting) 76 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes:  \nSodium 140 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEq/L\nChloride 100 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL\nCholesterol, total: 180 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 75 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 135 mg/dL\nHemoglobin (Hb%) 16 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)  85 fL\nReticulocyte count 0.9%\nErythrocyte count 5 million/mm\u00b3\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.5 \u00b5U/mL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose Negative\nKetones Negative\nLeucocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "An 84-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease is brought to the physician by her son for a follow-up examination. The patient lives with her son, who is her primary caregiver. He reports that it is becoming gradually more difficult to care for her. She occasionally has tantrums and there are times when she does not recognize him. She sleeps 6\u20138 hours throughout the day and is increasingly agitated and confused at night. When the phone, television, or oven beeps she thinks she is at the dentist's office and becomes very anxious. She eats 2\u20133 meals a day and has a good appetite. She has not fallen. She has not left the home in weeks except for short walks. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She takes levothyroxine, aspirin, warfarin, donepezil, verapamil, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 66/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 126/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The patient states that she is doing well and has some minor joint pain in both hips. She states that sometimes she is sad because her husband recently died. She lives alone and follows a vegan diet. The patient's daughter states that she has noticed her mother struggling with day to day life. It started 2 years ago with her forgetting simple instructions or having difficulty running errands. Now the patient has gotten to the point where she can no longer pay her bills. Sometimes the patient forgets how to get home. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) controlled with pantoprazole, and diabetes mellitus. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 158/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Past medical history is significant for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Surgical history is notable for an open cholecystectomy at age 38 and multiple cesarean sections. On arrival, she is non-responsive but breathing by herself, and her vital signs are T 102.9 F, HR 123 bpm, BP 95/64, RR 26/min, and SaO2 97% on 6L nasal cannula. On physical exam the patient has marked abdominal distension and is tympanic to percussion. Laboratory studies are notable for a lactic acidosis. An upright abdominal radiograph and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are shown in Figures A and B respectively. She is started on IV fluids and a nasogastric tube is placed to suction which returns green bilious fluid. Repeat vitals 1 hour later are T 101F, HR 140 bpm, BP 75/44, RR 30/min, and SaO2 is 100% on the ventilator after she is intubated for airway concerns. What is the next best step in management?",

He was started on levodopa after further evaluation led to a suspected diagnosis of Parkinson's disease; however, this therapy ultimately failed to improve the patient's symptoms. Additionally, over the ensuing 8 years since his initial presentation, the patient also developed symptoms including worsening balance, orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and impotence. The patient's overall condition deteriorated ever since this initial diagnosis with increasing disability from his motor symptoms, and he recently passed away at the age of 67, 8 years after his first presentation to his physician. The family requests an autopsy. Which of the following would be expected on autopsy evaluation of this patient's brain tissue?",

The patient\u2019s husband says that she has had intermittent problems with her memory for the past few years. He says she has occasional \u2018bad days\u2019 where her memory deteriorates to the point where she cannot perform activities of daily living. She is also sometimes found conversing in an empty room and, when inquired, she confirms that she is talking to a friend. There have also been had some recent falls. There is no history of fever, recent head trauma, loss of consciousness, or illicit drug use. Past medical history is significant for bronchial asthma and osteoarthritis, both managed medically. Her mother died due to metastatic breast cancer at age 71 and her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 65. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a tremor present in both her hands that attenuates with voluntary movement. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Romberg\u2019s sign is negative. She has a slow gait with a mild stooped posture. Her laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 12.9 g/dL\nWhite cell count  8,520/mm\u00b3\nPlatelets 295,000/mm\u00b3\nSerum creatinine  10 mg/dL\nGlucose 94 mg/dL\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 92 mg/dL\nFerritin 125 ng/mL\nSerum B12 305 ng/L\nTSH 2.1 \u00b5U/mL\nCeruloplasmin 45 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

Yesterday the patient seemed more confused than usual and was asking the same questions repetitively. His symptoms have not improved over the past 24 hours, thus the decision to bring him in today. Last year, the patient was almost completely independent but he then suffered a \"series of falls,\" after which his ability to care for himself declined. After this episode he was no longer able to cook for himself or pay his bills but otherwise had been fine up until this episode. The patient has a past medical history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, depression, diabetes mellitus type II, constipation, diverticulitis, and peripheral neuropathy. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, sodium docusate, atorvastatin, metoprolol, fluoxetine, and gabapentin. On exam you note a confused man who is poorly kept. He has bruises over his legs and his gait seems unstable. He is alert to person and place, and answers some questions inappropriately. The patient's pulse is 90/minute and his blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The son reports that when he returned home from work earlier in the day, he found his mother minimally responsive. She regained consciousness soon after his arrival and did not recall the event. The son also reports that for the past two years, his mother has had trouble remembering names and addresses. She still goes shopping on her own and cooks regularly. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She takes clomipramine, glyburide, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. She recently saw her primary care provider who adjusted some of her medication dosages. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, she is easily distractible with disorganized speech.

His symptoms started with misplacing items such as his wallet and keys around the house. Two months ago, he became unable to manage their finances as it became too difficult for him. Last week, he became lost while returning home from the grocery store. His wife reports that he shows \u201cno emotion\u201d and that he is seemingly not concerned by his recent symptoms. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, metformin, and rosuvastatin. His pulse is 56/min and blood pressure is 158/76 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows loss of sensation on his right leg and an unsteady gait. When asked to stand with his eyes closed and palms facing upward, his right arm rotates inward. An MRI of the brain shows multiple deep white matter lesions.

His wife reports he was initially experiencing lapses in memory and over the past 3 weeks he has begun having difficulties performing activities of daily living. Yesterday, he became lost heading to the post office down the street. He has hypertension treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Vital signs are within normal limits. He is alert but verbally uncommunicative. Muscle strength is normal. Reflexes are 2+ in bilateral upper and lower extremities. He has diffuse involuntary muscle jerking that can be provoked by loud noises. Mental status examination shows a blunt affect. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, creatine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer type, 5 years ago. The daughter has noticed that in the past 2 years, her mother has had increasing word-finding difficulties and forgetfulness. She was previously independent but now lives with her daughter and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and sometimes regurgitates her food. During this time, she has had a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She was treated twice for aspiration pneumonia and now her diet mainly consists of pureed food. She has no advance directives and her daughter says that when her mother was independent the patient mentioned that she would not want any resuscitation or life-sustaining measures if the need arose. The daughter wants to continue taking care of her mother but is concerned about her ability to do so. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but is well-groomed. The patient is oriented to self and recognizes her daughter by name, but she is unaware of the place or year. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 17/30. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B12 levels are within the reference range. Her serum albumin is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The daughter states that over the last several years, the patient has become forgetful and recently forgot her grandchild's name, along with the groceries she was supposed to buy. She was also found lost 10 miles away from her house last week. The daughter also states that the patient has had urinary incontinence over the last few months and has been seeing little children in the morning that are not present. The patient denies any recent falls. Her vitals are normal and her physical exam does not reveal any focal neurological deficits. Her mini-mental status exam is scored 22/30.

She is unable to remember recent events and can no longer recognize familiar people. She lives independently, but her daughter has hired a helper in the past month since the patient has found it difficult to shop or drive by herself. She has stopped attending family functions and refuses to visit the neighborhood clubhouse, where she used to conduct game nights for the residents. She has had a 7-kg (15-lb) weight gain over this period. She is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 36\u00b0C (97.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Mental status examination shows impaired attention and concentration; she has difficulty repeating seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence. She cannot recall any of the 3 objects shown to her after 10 minutes. She has no delusions or hallucinations. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?",

    "question": "A 71-year-old man is brought in by his daughter for forgetfulness. The daughter finds herself repeating things she has already told him. She also reports that the patient recently missed a lunch date they had scheduled. She is worried that he may have Alzheimer's disease because her mother had it, and this is how it started. The patient states that he sometimes forgets where he puts his glasses, but this is not new. He also admits to missing appointments if he doesn't write them in his planner, but he states \u201cI always remember birthdays.\u201d Since his wife passed, the patient has been responsible for all the finances, and the daughter confirms that he pays the bills on time. He cooks for himself, though sometimes he is \u201clazy\u201d and will order fast food. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. His medications include aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and methotrexate. He was also treated for depression for the first year following his wife's death, which was 3 years ago. He currently denies feelings of depression or suicidal ideation, but admits that he has been thinking more about death since some of his weekly golfing buddies have passed away. He drinks a beer every night with dinner and smokes cigars socially. A physical examination reveals ulnar deviation of the fingers, decreased grip strength, and a slow, steady gait. The patient is able to spell a 5-letter word backwards and remembers 3/3 items after 5 minutes. Which of the following diagnoses most likely explains the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because she is concerned about his speech being irregular. Specifically, she says that over the last 8 months, her husband has been saying increasingly nonsensical statements at home. In addition, he is no longer able to perform basic verbal tasks such as ordering from a menu or giving directions even though he was an English teacher prior to retirement. She also reports that he has recently started attempting to kiss strangers and urinate in public. Finally, she has also noticed that he has been frequently binge eating sweets even though he was previously very conscientious about his health. When asked about these activities, the patient does not have insight into his symptoms. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for memory difficulty. She states that for the past couple months she has had trouble with her memory including forgetting simple things like bills she needs to pay or locking doors. She was previously fully functional and did not make these types of mistakes. The patient has not been ill lately but came in because her daughter was concerned about her memory. She makes her own food and eats a varied diet. Review of systems is notable for a decrease in the patient\u2019s mood for the past 2 months since her husband died and a sensation that her limbs are heavy making it difficult for her to do anything. Her temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly woman. Her neurological exam is unremarkable; however, the patient struggles to recall 3 objects after a short period of time and can only recall 2 of them. The patient\u2019s weight is unchanged from her previous visit and cardiac, pulmonary, and dermatologic exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Three months ago, she started noticing that he appeared confused while doing simple tasks and seemed to be off balance. He has fallen several times over that time period. She has also noticed that if he is startled by one of their grandchildren, his arm starts to twitch uncontrollably. His past medical history is notable for transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He takes aspirin, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His family history is notable for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in his mother and maternal uncle. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals dysmetria and an ataxic gait.

    "question": "A 70-year-old man with a history of Alzheimer dementia presents to the emergency department with a change in his behavior. The patient has been more confused recently and had a fever. Upon presentation, he is too confused to answer questions. His temperature is 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 157/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is given 3 liters of IV fluids and acetaminophen and his vitals improve. He is also less confused. The patient is asking where he is and becomes combative and strikes a nurse when he finds out he has to be admitted to the hospital. He is given sedation and put in soft restraints. His mental status subsequently worsens and he becomes much more aggressive, spitting at nurses and attempting to bite his restraints. He also complains of abdominal pain. A post void residual volume is notable for a urine volume of 750 mL. Which of the following is the etiology of this patient\u2019s recent mental status change?",

He reports that 3 years ago she began to forget day-to-day things (e.g., where her keys are and the directions home). She would intermittently forget who her friends are and put the remote in the refrigerator. Recently, the husband noticed stark changes in her personality as she is more impatient, aggressive, and sometimes violent. She denies any fever, trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or sensory changes. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension for which she takes metformin and lisinopril, respectively. A physical examination is unremarkable.
