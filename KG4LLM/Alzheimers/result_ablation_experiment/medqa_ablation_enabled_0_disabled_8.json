He has difficulty remembering things and events, which has affected his job. He began using a diary to aid with remembering his agenda. His wife also says that he has wet his pants multiple times in the past 2 months and he avoids going out. He has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His past medical history is unremarkable. The vital signs include: blood pressure of 134/76 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 per minute, and a temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). His mini-mental state examination (MMSE) result is 22/30. His extraocular movements are normal. The muscle tone and strength are normal in all 4 limbs. The sensory examination is unremarkable. He has an absent Romberg\u2019s sign. He walks slowly, taking small steps, with feet wide apart as if his feet are stuck to the floor. The CT scan of the head is shown in the image.

The daughter noticed that he has gradually become more forgetful and withdrawn over the last year. He frequently misplaces his car keys and forgets the names of his neighbors, whom he has known for 30 years. He has difficulty recalling his address and telephone number. He recently had an episode of urinary and fecal incontinence. Last week, his neighbor found him wandering the parking lot of the grocery store. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 18 years ago. His current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He appears healthy; BMI is 23 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg. Mini-mental state examination score is 19/30. He is not bothered by his forgetfulness. Cranial nerves II\u2013XII are intact. He has 5/5 strength and full sensation to light touch in all extremities. His patellar, Achilles, and biceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. His gait is steady. MRI scan of the brain shows ventriculomegaly and prominent cerebral sulci.

    "question": "A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation by a physician with complaints of worsening forgetfulness and confusion for 1 year. According to his wife, he has always been in good health and is generally very happy; however, he has started to forget important things. He recently had his driving license revoked because of multiple tickets, but he cannot recall having done anything wrong. This morning, he neglected to put on his socks and was quite agitated when she pointed this out to him. He denies having a depressed mood, sleep problems, or loss of interest. He occasionally has a glass of wine with dinner and has never smoked or used recreational drugs. His medical history and family medical history are unremarkable. His pulse is 68/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Except for a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 20/30, the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT of the brain, reveal no pathologic findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also normal. Laboratory testing showed the following:\nSerum glucose (fasting) 76 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes:  \nSodium 140 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEq/L\nChloride 100 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL\nCholesterol, total: 180 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 75 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 135 mg/dL\nHemoglobin (Hb%) 16 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)  85 fL\nReticulocyte count 0.9%\nErythrocyte count 5 million/mm\u00b3\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.5 \u00b5U/mL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose Negative\nKetones Negative\nLeucocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Past medical history is significant for Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Surgical history is notable for an open cholecystectomy at age 38 and multiple cesarean sections. On arrival, she is non-responsive but breathing by herself, and her vital signs are T 102.9 F, HR 123 bpm, BP 95/64, RR 26/min, and SaO2 97% on 6L nasal cannula. On physical exam the patient has marked abdominal distension and is tympanic to percussion. Laboratory studies are notable for a lactic acidosis. An upright abdominal radiograph and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are shown in Figures A and B respectively. She is started on IV fluids and a nasogastric tube is placed to suction which returns green bilious fluid. Repeat vitals 1 hour later are T 101F, HR 140 bpm, BP 75/44, RR 30/min, and SaO2 is 100% on the ventilator after she is intubated for airway concerns. What is the next best step in management?",

The patient\u2019s husband says that she has had intermittent problems with her memory for the past few years. He says she has occasional \u2018bad days\u2019 where her memory deteriorates to the point where she cannot perform activities of daily living. She is also sometimes found conversing in an empty room and, when inquired, she confirms that she is talking to a friend. There have also been had some recent falls. There is no history of fever, recent head trauma, loss of consciousness, or illicit drug use. Past medical history is significant for bronchial asthma and osteoarthritis, both managed medically. Her mother died due to metastatic breast cancer at age 71 and her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 65. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a tremor present in both her hands that attenuates with voluntary movement. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Romberg\u2019s sign is negative. She has a slow gait with a mild stooped posture. Her laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 12.9 g/dL\nWhite cell count  8,520/mm\u00b3\nPlatelets 295,000/mm\u00b3\nSerum creatinine  10 mg/dL\nGlucose 94 mg/dL\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 92 mg/dL\nFerritin 125 ng/mL\nSerum B12 305 ng/L\nTSH 2.1 \u00b5U/mL\nCeruloplasmin 45 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

She was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer type, 5 years ago. The daughter has noticed that in the past 2 years, her mother has had increasing word-finding difficulties and forgetfulness. She was previously independent but now lives with her daughter and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and sometimes regurgitates her food. During this time, she has had a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She was treated twice for aspiration pneumonia and now her diet mainly consists of pureed food. She has no advance directives and her daughter says that when her mother was independent the patient mentioned that she would not want any resuscitation or life-sustaining measures if the need arose. The daughter wants to continue taking care of her mother but is concerned about her ability to do so. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but is well-groomed. The patient is oriented to self and recognizes her daughter by name, but she is unaware of the place or year. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 17/30. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities.

The patient states that he sometimes forgets where he puts his glasses, but this is not new. He also admits to missing appointments if he doesn't write them in his planner, but he states \u201cI always remember birthdays.\u201d Since his wife passed, the patient has been responsible for all the finances, and the daughter confirms that he pays the bills on time. He cooks for himself, though sometimes he is \u201clazy\u201d and will order fast food. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. His medications include aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and methotrexate. He was also treated for depression for the first year following his wife's death, which was 3 years ago. He currently denies feelings of depression or suicidal ideation, but admits that he has been thinking more about death since some of his weekly golfing buddies have passed away. He drinks a beer every night with dinner and smokes cigars socially. A physical examination reveals ulnar deviation of the fingers, decreased grip strength, and a slow, steady gait.

She states that for the past couple months she has had trouble with her memory including forgetting simple things like bills she needs to pay or locking doors. She was previously fully functional and did not make these types of mistakes. The patient has not been ill lately but came in because her daughter was concerned about her memory. She makes her own food and eats a varied diet. Review of systems is notable for a decrease in the patient\u2019s mood for the past 2 months since her husband died and a sensation that her limbs are heavy making it difficult for her to do anything. Her temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly woman. Her neurological exam is unremarkable; however, the patient struggles to recall 3 objects after a short period of time and can only recall 2 of them. The patient\u2019s weight is unchanged from her previous visit and cardiac, pulmonary, and dermatologic exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Three months ago, she started noticing that he appeared confused while doing simple tasks and seemed to be off balance. He has fallen several times over that time period. She has also noticed that if he is startled by one of their grandchildren, his arm starts to twitch uncontrollably. His past medical history is notable for transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He takes aspirin, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin. He has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His family history is notable for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in his mother and maternal uncle. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical examination reveals dysmetria and an ataxic gait.

He was in his usual state of health until a few days ago when he has started to become confused, lethargic, forgetful, and repeating the same questions. Over the last few days, he sometimes appears perfectly normal, and, at other times, he has difficulty recognizing his family members. Yesterday, he was screaming that the room was filled with snakes. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed medically, and chronic kidney disease, for which he undergoes regular hemodialysis on alternate days. There is no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His vitals include: blood pressure 129/88 mm Hg, pulse 112/min, temperature 38.2\u00b0C (100.8\u00b0F), and respiratory rate 20/min. The patient is oriented only to person and place. His mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score is 18/30, where he had difficulty performing basic arithmetic calculations and recalled only 1 out of 3 objects. Nuchal rigidity is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
