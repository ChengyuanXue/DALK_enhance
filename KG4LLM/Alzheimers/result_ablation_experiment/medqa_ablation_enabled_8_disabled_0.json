His daughter says that over the past several months he has been more aggressive towards friends and family. She also reports several episodes in which he claimed to see two strangers in her apartment. He sometimes stares blankly for several minutes and does not react when addressed. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and was diagnosed with Parkinson disease 10 months ago. His current medications include carbidopa-levodopa, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented to person and place but not to time. There is a resting tremor in his right upper extremities. There is muscle rigidity in the upper and lower extremities. He is able to walk without assistance but has a slow gait with short steps. Mental status examination shows short-term memory deficits. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",

    "question": "A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation by a physician with complaints of worsening forgetfulness and confusion for 1 year. According to his wife, he has always been in good health and is generally very happy; however, he has started to forget important things. He recently had his driving license revoked because of multiple tickets, but he cannot recall having done anything wrong. This morning, he neglected to put on his socks and was quite agitated when she pointed this out to him. He denies having a depressed mood, sleep problems, or loss of interest. He occasionally has a glass of wine with dinner and has never smoked or used recreational drugs. His medical history and family medical history are unremarkable. His pulse is 68/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. Except for a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 20/30, the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT of the brain, reveal no pathologic findings. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also normal. Laboratory testing showed the following:\nSerum glucose (fasting) 76 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes:  \nSodium 140 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.1 mEq/L\nChloride 100 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen 11 mg/dL\nCholesterol, total: 180 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 75 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 135 mg/dL\nHemoglobin (Hb%) 16 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)  85 fL\nReticulocyte count 0.9%\nErythrocyte count 5 million/mm\u00b3\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.5 \u00b5U/mL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose Negative\nKetones Negative\nLeucocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 2 years. Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her. She has hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, enalapril, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. She is alert and oriented to place and person but not to time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. Her speech rhythm is normal but is frequently interrupted as she thinks of words to frame her sentences. She makes multiple errors while performing serial sevens. Her clock drawing is impaired and she draws 14 numbers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her husband with complaints of cognitive decline. The patient\u2019s husband says that she has had intermittent problems with her memory for the past few years. He says she has occasional \u2018bad days\u2019 where her memory deteriorates to the point where she cannot perform activities of daily living. She is also sometimes found conversing in an empty room and, when inquired, she confirms that she is talking to a friend. There have also been had some recent falls. There is no history of fever, recent head trauma, loss of consciousness, or illicit drug use. Past medical history is significant for bronchial asthma and osteoarthritis, both managed medically. Her mother died due to metastatic breast cancer at age 71 and her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 65. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a tremor present in both her hands that attenuates with voluntary movement. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Romberg\u2019s sign is negative. She has a slow gait with a mild stooped posture. Her laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin 12.9 g/dL\nWhite cell count  8,520/mm\u00b3\nPlatelets 295,000/mm\u00b3\nSerum creatinine  10 mg/dL\nGlucose 94 mg/dL\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 92 mg/dL\nFerritin 125 ng/mL\nSerum B12 305 ng/L\nTSH 2.1 \u00b5U/mL\nCeruloplasmin 45 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

    "question": "A 67-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her son for unusual behavior. She moved into her son\u2019s house three years ago after her husband passed away. The son reports that when he returned home from work earlier in the day, he found his mother minimally responsive. She regained consciousness soon after his arrival and did not recall the event. The son also reports that for the past two years, his mother has had trouble remembering names and addresses. She still goes shopping on her own and cooks regularly. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She takes clomipramine, glyburide, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. She recently saw her primary care provider who adjusted some of her medication dosages. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, she is easily distractible with disorganized speech. She does not recognize her son and thinks that her intravenous line is a rope. She says she feels fine and would like to go home. Brain imaging would likely reveal which of the following?",

The policemen report that the patient could not recall where he was or how he got there. Medical history is significant for multiple prior hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis. He also has scheduled visits with a psychiatrist for managing his depression and substance abuse. On physical examination, the patient was found to have horizontal nystagmus and a wide-based gait with short-spaced steps. The patient is started on appropriate medication and admitted to the medicine floor. He was re-evaluated after treatment implementation and currently does not appear confused. When asked how he got to the hospital, the patient says, \"I remember leaving my wallet here and thought I should pick it up.\" On cognitive testing the patient is noted to have impairments in judgement, sequencing tasks, and memory. Which of the following enzymes was most likely impaired in this patient?",

    "question": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer type, 5 years ago. The daughter has noticed that in the past 2 years, her mother has had increasing word-finding difficulties and forgetfulness. She was previously independent but now lives with her daughter and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and sometimes regurgitates her food. During this time, she has had a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She was treated twice for aspiration pneumonia and now her diet mainly consists of pureed food. She has no advance directives and her daughter says that when her mother was independent the patient mentioned that she would not want any resuscitation or life-sustaining measures if the need arose. The daughter wants to continue taking care of her mother but is concerned about her ability to do so. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but is well-groomed. The patient is oriented to self and recognizes her daughter by name, but she is unaware of the place or year. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 17/30. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B12 levels are within the reference range. Her serum albumin is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

She also reports that the patient recently missed a lunch date they had scheduled. She is worried that he may have Alzheimer's disease because her mother had it, and this is how it started. The patient states that he sometimes forgets where he puts his glasses, but this is not new. He also admits to missing appointments if he doesn't write them in his planner, but he states \u201cI always remember birthdays.\u201d Since his wife passed, the patient has been responsible for all the finances, and the daughter confirms that he pays the bills on time. He cooks for himself, though sometimes he is \u201clazy\u201d and will order fast food. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. His medications include aspirin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and methotrexate. He was also treated for depression for the first year following his wife's death, which was 3 years ago. He currently denies feelings of depression or suicidal ideation, but admits that he has been thinking more about death since some of his weekly golfing buddies have passed away. He drinks a beer every night with dinner and smokes cigars socially. A physical examination reveals ulnar deviation of the fingers, decreased grip strength, and a slow, steady gait. The patient is able to spell a 5-letter word backwards and remembers 3/3 items after 5 minutes. Which of the following diagnoses most likely explains the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for memory difficulty. She states that for the past couple months she has had trouble with her memory including forgetting simple things like bills she needs to pay or locking doors. She was previously fully functional and did not make these types of mistakes. The patient has not been ill lately but came in because her daughter was concerned about her memory. She makes her own food and eats a varied diet. Review of systems is notable for a decrease in the patient\u2019s mood for the past 2 months since her husband died and a sensation that her limbs are heavy making it difficult for her to do anything. Her temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly woman. Her neurological exam is unremarkable; however, the patient struggles to recall 3 objects after a short period of time and can only recall 2 of them. The patient\u2019s weight is unchanged from her previous visit and cardiac, pulmonary, and dermatologic exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The patient is given 3 liters of IV fluids and acetaminophen and his vitals improve. He is also less confused. The patient is asking where he is and becomes combative and strikes a nurse when he finds out he has to be admitted to the hospital. He is given sedation and put in soft restraints. His mental status subsequently worsens and he becomes much more aggressive, spitting at nurses and attempting to bite his restraints. He also complains of abdominal pain. A post void residual volume is notable for a urine volume of 750 mL. Which of the following is the etiology of this patient\u2019s recent mental status change?",
